# Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive webside to expose UFO sighting data to the community.  This allows enthusiasts access to data that was previously unavailable to them.  Javascript, CSS, and bootstrap were used in combination to create an engaging and interactive user experience.


## Results
The site's introduction describes how community leaders reacted to the project, and prompts users to do their own research using the data provided and prompts feedback.

Enthusiasts are able to filter the data by date, city, state, country, and shape.  Multiple filters may be applied at one time as well, allowing the user to analyze the data for clusters or trends in events.

# Summary
The website provides a rich experience for UFO enthusiasts to preview UFO sighting data and form their own conclusions.  This site meets the criteria for a minimum viable product, but could be improved.

## Drawback
One drawback of this sight is that it doesn't provide a method for enthusiasts to provide feedback on their observations as prompted in the introduction on the page.

## Recommendations
- Create a message board for enthusiasts to communicate and collaborate on ideas
- Work on freeform text elements to escape special characters and improve content display
